## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Development Stack
* **Framework:** Flutter (for cross-platform mobile development)
* **Backend:** Google Firebase
    * **Firestore:** NoSQL Cloud Database for storing user profiles, events, academic resources, faculty, alumni, and goals data.
    * **Authentication:** For user signup, login, and role management.
* **Image Storage:** Cloudinary (for efficient storage and delivery of profile pictures and event images).
* **Routing:** Flutter's Navigator 1.0 with named routes and `onGenerateRoute` for dynamic arguments.
* **State Management:** `setState` (for local widget state) and `StreamBuilder`/`FutureBuilder` (for real-time data from Firestore).

### Important Considerations
* **Firebase Project Setup:** This app requires a Firebase project configured with Firestore and Authentication (Email/Password).
* **Firestore Security Rules:** Proper Firestore security rules are crucial for data access control. The provided rules ensure users can only access their own sensitive data, while allowing role-based creation/editing of public-facing content.
* **Cloudinary Configuration:** A Cloudinary account with an "Unsigned" upload preset is necessary for image uploads (specifically `flutter_profile_pics` as used in `cloudinary_service.dart`).
* **`pubspec.yaml`:** All required dependencies (firebase\_core, firebase\_auth, cloud\_firestore, url\_launcher, intl, cupertino\_icons, image\_picker, firebase\_storage, flip\_card, provider, google\_sign\_in, http).
* **Native Platform Setup:**
    * **Android (`AndroidManifest.xml`):** Requires `INTERNET`, `CAMERA`, `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions and a `<queries>` block for `url_launcher` compatibility on Android 11+.
    * **iOS (`Info.plist`):** Requires `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`, `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` entries for `image_picker` to function.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Project Setup:**
    * Create a new Flutter project: `flutter create hogwarts_campus_connect`
    * coded from scratch
2.  **Set up Firebase:**
    * Create a new Firebase project.
    * Set up Firestore Database, Firebase Authentication (Enable Email/Password and Google Sign-In).
    * Copy your `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) into the `android/app` and `ios/Runner` directories respectively.
    * **Deploy Firestore Security Rules:** Use the latest rules provided in the project documentation/discussions to ensure proper access control.
    * **Deploy Firebase Storage Rules (if using Firebase Storage):** Though Cloudinary is primary for profiles, if Firebase Storage is a fallback, ensure its rules are set up.
3.  **Set up Cloudinary:**
    * Create a Cloudinary account.
    * Go to **Settings > Upload**.
    * Create an **"Unsigned" upload preset** (e.g., `flutter_profile_pics`).
    * Update `lib/services/cloudinary_service.dart` with your actual `cloudName` and `uploadPreset`.
4.  **Update `pubspec.yaml`:**
    * Ensure all `assets:` and `fonts:` sections are uncommented and correctly indented, pointing to your image and font files.
    * Run `flutter pub get` in your terminal.
5.  **Configure Native Platforms:**
    * **Android:** Update `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` with all necessary permissions and `<queries>` block as discussed. Also `android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"` in `<application>` tag.
    * **iOS:** Update `ios/Runner/Info.plist` with privacy descriptions.
6.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    flutter clean #Clean previous builds
    flutter pub get # Fetches dependencies and assets
    flutter run #Builds and runs the application
    ```

## üêû Troubleshooting
* **"RenderFlex overflowed by X pixels":** Adjust `SizedBox` heights, `Padding`, or use `Expanded` and `Flexible` widgets within `Row`/`Column` to give content more room.
* **"Could not find a generator for route...":** Check `main.dart`'s `routes` and `onGenerateRoute` for correct route names and arguments.
* **"Unable to locate asset entry in pubspec.yaml":** Verify `pubspec.yaml` indentation, asset folder paths, and run `flutter pub get`.
* **"Could not launch https...":** Ensure `AndroidManifest.xml` (for Android 11+) has the correct `<queries>` block for URL schemes.
* **Profile Picture/Image Picker Issues:** Check `AndroidManifest.xml` (for Android media permissions), `Info.plist` (for iOS privacy descriptions), and your Cloudinary settings (cloud name, upload preset mode).
* **Data Not Showing/Saving:** Double-check your Firestore Security Rules and ensure field names in your model classes (`Event`, `Alumni`, `Faculty`, `Goal`) exactly match the field names in your Firestore documents.
